# PyBer_Analysis
## PurposeOverview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
1. To calculate metrics related to the total weekly fares for each city type the rideshare company operates in.
2. Create line, bar, scatter, bubble, pie, and box-and-whisker plots using Matplotlib.
3. Determine mean, median, and mode using Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy statistics.
## Result

The urban city type had more total drivers than total rides, which had a significant effect on average fare per ride and average fare per driver. The urban drivers earned significantly less than the rural drivers and had the lowest average fare per ride. The Rural city type had the fewest total drivers, resulting in the highest average fare per driver, despite having the same ratio of total rides to total drivers as the Suburban city type.

### Total Fare by City Type

We can quickly see from this time period's analysis of total fares for each of the city types that urban city types had the highest total fares for all weeks and rural areas had the lowest. We can also see that the third week of February has the highest total fares for each city type, indicating that demand is high at that time. In the first and third weeks of March, urban cities appear to bring in a lot of money. All fares for each city type are decreasing between the beginning of January 2019 and the end of April.

## Summary and Recommendations:
1. The summary's findings DataFrame could be because urban city types are more compact, resulting in a lower average fare per ride, whereas rural city types are more spread out, resulting in a higher average fare per ride. PyBer should work to include mileage distance data as part of the data collection and analysis process to test this theory.
2. Because urban city types have more total drivers than total rides, urban drivers may not have enough work to support themselves. PyBer should consider investing advertising dollars in urban city types to increase total rides or risk losing urban drivers.
3. If PyBer were to invest in advertising dollars in the Urban city type, the next question would be when the ads would be most effective. After reviewing the Total Fare by City Tpye graph, the end of February marks the beginning of the increase in total fares and would be an ideal time to launch an advertising campaign that would also benefit the other two city types strategically.
